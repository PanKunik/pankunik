# 💫 About me
- 👋 Hello, GitHub! I'm @PanKunik and I'm a .NET Developer.
- 💻 Programming is my day-to-day work in BMS Sp. z o. o. company.
- 🔭 Working on my "pet-project" called `smuget` (more about it below).
- 🌱 Curently I'm learning about `Domain-Driven Design`, `Clean Architecture` and trying to get better in `.NET`, `Docker` and software testing every day I'm coding.
- 🍞 In my spare time I bake a lot of sourdough bread. <br /> 🚴‍♂️ When there is a good weather I like to go for a ride on my bicycle. <br /> 🏂 If there is cold outside and snowy I go snowboarding!
- ⚡ Fun fact: `System.ValueType` is a reference type!

## 👇 Current project

- `smuget` is a smart home budget 🏡 application for managing your finances 💵. It allows users to create their monthly billings and add plans 🌤️ , incomes ➕ and expenses ➖ for tracking their budget.
