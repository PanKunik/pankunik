# 💫 About me
- 👋 Hello, GitHub! I'm @PanKunik and I'm a .NET Developer.
- 💻 Programming is my day-to-day work in JAS-FBG S.A. company.
- 🔭 Working on my "pet-project" called `smuget` (more about it below).
- 🌱 Curently I'm learning about `Domain-Driven Design`, `Clean Architecture` and trying to get better in `.NET`, `Docker` and software testing every day I'm coding.
- 🍞 In my spare time I bake a lot of sourdough bread.
- 🚴‍♂️ When there is a good weather I like to go for a ride on my bicycle.
- 🏂 If there is cold outside and snowy I go snowbaording!
- ⚡ Fun fact: `System.ValueType` is a reference type!
